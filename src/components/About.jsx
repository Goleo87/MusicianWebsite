      <h1>Bio</h1>
      <p>
        My name is Stefano, I was born in Venezuela in the bosom of a family of
        Italian immigrants, since I was a child I was interested in
        communication, arts and technology, so in 2007 I undertook the trip to
        Mexico to learn more, where I stayed until 2011, There I started working
        in music independently where I produced my first and only album as a
        singer-songwriter, later in 2013 I took the decision to improve my
        professional skills and began to study journalism in the specialty of
        audiovisual production, at the arturo michelena university in San Diego,
        Venezuela.

        In 2020, due to the global pandemic and the social and political
        situation, I decided to move to Germany to continue developing myself,
        working, learning the German language, while restarting my creative
        projects such as my music and a humor and entertainment podcast that I
        am currently working on with Daniela Deutsch.

        Currently, I am finishing my studies as a web developer at the DCI
        Career Institute here in Germany, in order to complement my previous
        knowledge and acquire the necessary competitiveness to position myself
        within the German job market.
